Hello world for git

Hello everyone,
I am Amit. I have joined Arrcus on 21st of Jan. I did my Btech from ISM dhanbad and joined Arista Networks as software engineer. At Arista I worked on multiple trident chipsets. Main area of my interest was Vxlan.

Outside of work I have interests in automobiles. Recently picked up playing badminton :) 

Looking forward to work with amazing people at Arrcus.
